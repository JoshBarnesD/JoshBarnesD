## Yo! ðŸ¤™

My name's Joshua but most people call me Josh and I'm a full-stack dev based out of Stockholm.
I started my dev journey as a web developer but in recent years been deeply involved in mobile solutions, primarily with React Native!

I have mostly worked on private repos but have contributed to some open-source packages for React Native. You can check them out in my pinned repo section!
